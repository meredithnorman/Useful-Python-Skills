# Useful-Python-Skills
This repository will store useful snippets of Python code that I have developed in my Intermediate Python course. Useful may be a stretch for these functions/code snippets but you never know! Some code may require additional files to be loaded.

*Determmining text metrics.py* <br>
This code allows the user to select any txt file. An exception handling step is included if the user enters an invalid file name. The code then calculates the total number of lines, the total number of words and the total number of characters in this txt file. <br> <br>
*Removing Strings from txt files.py* <br>
This code allows the user to select any txt file. An exception handling step is included if the user enters an invalid file name. The user is then prompted to enter a word for the program to remove all instances of in the text file. The program then rewrites the txt file with the removed word. The code is not restricted to stand-alone occurences, it will remove all occurences of the word, for instance if the word to remove is *at* then *what* will become *wh*. <br> <br>
*Summary Statistics from a txt file of numbers.py* <br>
This code allows the user to select a txt file of numbers. The code then determines how many numbers there, the total of the numbers and the average of the numbers. <br> <br>
*Replacing text in a txt file.py* <br>
This code allows the user to select any txt file. An exception handling step is included if the user enters an invalid file name. The code then prompts the user to select a word in the text file to replace and a word to replace it with. This request is executed and a new txt file is saved with the updated words.
