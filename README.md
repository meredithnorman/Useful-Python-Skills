# Useful-Python-Skills
This repository will store useful snippets of Python code that I have developed in my Intermediate Python course. Some code may require additional files to be loaded.

*Determmining text metrics.py*
This code allows the user to select any txt file. An exception handling step is included if the user enters an invalid file name. The code then calculates the total number of lines, the total number of words and the total number of characters. 
*Removing Strings from txt files.py*
This code allows the user to select any txt file. An exception handling step is included if the user enters an invalid file name. The user is then prompted to enter a word for the program to remove all instances of in the text file. The program then rewrites the text file with the removed word.
